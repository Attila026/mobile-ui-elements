force-sobject element provides a custom component for Force.SObject from Mobile SDK's SmartSync JS. It allows apps to easily perform CRUD operations against a salesforce sobject in both online & offline modes. For Offline use, the application should first create a Smartstore soup with same name as the target sobject.

To use this component, specify the sobject name and the recordid.

Example:

    <force-sobject sobject="Account" recordid="0010000000AAA" autosync></force-sobject>

@group Salesforce Mobile Elements
@element force-sobject
    
@events:
    save: when the data has been successfully saved to the server.
    sync: when the data has been successfully synced with the server.
    destroy: when a record is deleted.
    error: when a request to remote server has failed.
    invalid: when the data validation fails on the client.
