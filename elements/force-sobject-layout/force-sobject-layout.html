<!--
    force-ui-detail element enables the rendering of full view of a salesforce record. It extends the force-sobject element to allow all the CRUD operations on an SObject. This element can auto detect the record's relevant page layout and renders the details accordingly.
    Why: a) Reads the layout settings of an object and renders the detail accordingly.
    b) Provides a simpler DOM based interface to fetch full or partial record.

    @attributes:
    hasrecordtypes: (Optional) Default: false. Mark this as true, if the sobject has multiple record types.
    recordtypeid: (Optional) Default: None. If provided, the layout associated with this recordtypeid is rendered.
